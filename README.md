# Warehouse Automation Dashboard

This project is a simple warehouse monitoring dashboard built using **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It covers the basic features given in the assignment such as robot status, task tracking, and inventory overview.

I tried to keep the UI clean, minimal, and easy to understand.  
All the pages are fully responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile screens.
